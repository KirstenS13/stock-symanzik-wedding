# stock-symanzik-wedding
A simple static wedding website for my sister and her husband, built in basic HTML, CSS, and LESS.

This was built during my first few months at Lambda School and was a useful way to practice the HTML, CSS, LESS, and responsive web design principles I had learned at the time.
It is the first non-Lambda project I created.
