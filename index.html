We will also be hosting a larger gathering in 2021 for all our guests.</p>

            <h3>What is a livestream?</h3>
            <p>A livestream is a video setup that allows viewers to witness the video as it is being recorded. What this means is that any of our guests navigating to this page will be able to witness, at the exact same time as our in-person attendees, the ceremony unfold. You will get to see all the funny, heartfelt moments at the same time as those sitting with us in Michigan - albeit from the comfort of your own home.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="para2 text-block">
            <h3>How do I use it?</h3>
            <!-- <p>To use the livestream there are two steps.</p> -->
            <div class="flex-container">
                <h4>Step 1:</h4>
                <p>Go online and find your way back to this page about 10 minutes before 4:00pm on Saturday, June 13th, 2020.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="flex-container">
                <h4>Step 2:</h4>
                <p>Using your mouse, scroll to the bottom of this page. You should see a box - at this moment it shows a picture of our cats, Edmund (Black) and Lucy (Ginger) - when we start recording the livestream video will replace our cats</p>

        </div>
        <div class="para3 text-block">
            <h3>When will it be available?</h3>
            <p>The livestream will be available at 3:50pm, Saturday, June 13th, 2020. At the moment all you can see is a box with two adorable cats (our Edmund and Lucy). At 3:50pm on Saturday, June 13th, 2020 our cats will disappear and a video will appear instead, showing you live video of the wedding</p>

        <!--Too Wordy-->
        <!--
        <h3>What is most useful to us at this time is funding for our life endeavours.</h3>
        <p>In our current living situations, and because we intend to relocate in the next two years, we do not have much room for physical gifts. However, family history is very important to us and we welcome any gifts this help us continue our family legacies. Hand-crafted gifts or keepsakes are also welcome.</p>
        <p>We will be using PayPal for monetary gifts, but checks in person are welcome too!</p>
        <h3>Visiting David's family and honeymoon fund</h3>
        <p>Once it is safe to travel, we intend to go on a trip to the UK. This visit serves two purposes, as it will allow us to have a celebration of our wedding in the UK and Ireland for members of David's family unable to attend the US wedding due to the coronavirus travel restrictions. Additionally, we will have our honeymoon and do some sightseeing. We hope to go on a 2-3 week trip in order to have enough time to spend with family.</p>
        <a href="#">Give a Monetary Gift</a>
        <h3>Relocation and Moving Fund</h3>
        <p>David is hoping to get into a PhD program for archaeology, so we will be relocating at some point in the next two years so we can be closer to David's school. This fund will help us as we set up a home together in a new place!</p>
        <a href="#">Give a Monetary Gift</a>
        <h3>Student Loan Repayment Fund</h3>
        <p>David and Mikayla both have student loan debt, Mikayla from her in-progress bachelor degree in English Secondary Education with an ESL minor and teaching license, and David from his bachelor in Archaeology and masters in Aegean Bronze Age Archaeology. Helping us reduce our debt would be a huge blessing as we begin our married life.</p>
        <a href="#">Give a Monetary Gift</a>
        <h3>Wedding Costs Fund</h3>
        <p>Any financial gifts towards covering the operational costs of our wedding would be appreciated.</p>
